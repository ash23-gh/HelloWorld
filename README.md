# About Me
Hello, my name is Akshay and I currently work as a VMware administrator at M3BI. I am excited to share some information about myself in this README, as I am an aspiring DevOps engineer looking to further develop my skills and knowledge in this field

# My Career Passion
I have a strong passion for learning new technologies and have always been interested in gaining a high-level understanding of how things work. During my time at M3BI, I was introduced to scripting, which sparked my interest in pursuing a career in IT that would allow me to continue to expand my knowledge in this area.

After researching different IT roles, I came across DevOps and realized that it would be the perfect fit for me. With my operations background and my interest in scripting, I believe that DevOps would be the ideal next step in my career, as it would allow me to use my skills and knowledge to help companies streamline their operations and improve their overall efficiency.
